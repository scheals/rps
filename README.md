## Reflections

This was my third project with The Odin Project. It first started as a console-only game and was my first real journey into creating something with JavaScript out of scratch.
If I were to do this again I wouldn't rely so much on `if` statements and use `switch` instead to improve code readibility. I am very happy that I decided to implement the Game Log because it proved to be a very good exercise in DOM Manipulation and really did test my patience and grit with the amount of problems it created for me. I revisited this project to *actually* fit the specification of playing to 5 wins while already being wiser after doing an Etch-A-Sketch project and already dabbling in Calculator project and that experience has proven crucial for an easy programming experience especially since I've decided to keep the "play five rounds" mode of the game. Overall I can say that this project taught me:

* The basics of JavaScript
* Basics of DOM Manipulation with JavaScript
* Debugging prowess
* How to use emojis in code
* Creating and merging branches in git
